                  Welcome to our site, Crowned Jewels. This site is to encourage and support moms, along with providing a place to ask questions, concerns, and advice about parenting. Other people can respond with their own advice, stories and encouragement.

                  <br/>
                  My goal for this site is  to be a safe place for all mothers to be encouraged and get advice. I envision moms posting questions and requests for advice and other mothers sharing their advice, everything feeling supported and encouraged.
